Game Concept:

Set in a microscopic world where different mushroom species compete for resources
Players build and expand their fungal networks
Gather resources, research upgrades, and battle other mushroom colonies


Core Mechanics:

Resource gathering (water, nutrients, carbon)
Base building (mycelium network expansion)
Unit production (different types of spores and specialized hyphae)
Technology tree (evolve and unlock new abilities)
Combat system (chemical warfare, physical battles between hyphae)


Godot 4 Setup:

Download and install Godot 4
Create a new project
Set up the basic project structure (scenes, scripts, assets folders)


Basic Implementation Steps:
a. Create the game world:

Design a tilemap system for the soil environment
Implement camera movement and zoom functionality

b. Resource system:

Create resource nodes (water droplets, nutrient patches)
Implement resource collection mechanics

c. Base building:

Design basic mycelium expansion mechanics
Create simple structures (spore launchers, nutrient storage)

d. Unit system:

Implement basic unit movement and pathfinding
Create different unit types (gatherer hyphae, defender hyphae, spores)

e. Combat system:

Implement basic combat mechanics between units
Create effects for chemical warfare

f. User Interface:

Design and implement a basic HUD
Create menus for unit production and research


Art and Sound:

Develop a unique, microscopic art style
Create or source mushroom-themed assets
Compose or acquire fitting background music and sound effects


Multiplayer (optional):

Implement basic networking for multiplayer matches
Create lobby system for game setup


AI opponents:

Develop basic AI for single-player mode
Implement different difficulty levels


Polishing:

Balance gameplay and economy
Add tutorials and help system
Implement save/load functionality


Distribution:

Set up the game for export in Godot
Create store pages (Steam, itch.io, etc.)
Price the game at $4.99


Post-launch:

Gather player feedback
Plan for updates and possible expansions
