To recreate and expand this concept into a more fully-fledged game suitable for a Steam release using Godot 4, you could consider the following approach:

Ideas:
- Age of Empires style
- Mod support
- Mushroom theme
- You are the prince of a mushroom kingdom which was taken by a dragon, you must rebuild with your 13 mushrooms
- Different speices of mushrooms for other factions (Elves, Hobbits, Orks, etc)
