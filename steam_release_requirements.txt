For a $4.99 Steam release of Tiny Village, you'll want to provide enough content and polish to justify the price point while keeping the scope manageable. Here's a minimal set of requirements that could make for an engaging experience:

1. Core Gameplay:
   - Isometric grid-based village building
   - At least 20 unique placeable items across categories (buildings, nature, roads, decorations)
   - Simple resource management system (e.g., coins, wood, stone)
   - Population growth mechanics tied to housing and amenities

2. Progression:
   - Unlock new buildings and items as the village grows
   - Achievement system with at least 10 achievements
   - Multiple map sizes or themes (e.g., grassland, desert, snow)

3. User Interface:
   - Intuitive building placement and rotation
   - Category-based item selection menu
   - Resource and population display
   - Basic tutorial or hint system

4. Graphics and Sound:
   - Consistent, charming art style (e.g., low-poly 3D or detailed 2D sprites)
   - Day/night cycle with lighting changes
   - Ambient sound effects and background music
   - Simple animations for buildings and nature elements

5. Save System:
   - Ability to save and load multiple villages
   - Autosave feature

6. Performance and Polish:
   - Stable performance on mid-range PCs
   - No game-breaking bugs
   - Basic particle effects (e.g., smoke from chimneys, water sparkles)

7. Steam Integration:
   - Steam Cloud save support
   - Trading cards (optional, but adds value)

8. Minimal Replayability Features:
   - Random events affecting the village (e.g., weather, visitors)
   - Basic quest or goal system to guide gameplay

Suggested Genre for Steam Release:
"Casual City-Builder" or "Relaxing Village Simulator"

These genres would accurately represent the game's laid-back, creative nature while setting appropriate expectations for potential buyers. You could use tags like:

- Casual
- City Builder
- Indie
- Simulation
- Relaxing
- Isometric
- Strategy



To expand on this concept and make it more appealing for the $4.99 price point, consider adding:

1. A simple narrative or story mode
2. Customization options for buildings (e.g., color schemes)
3. Seasonal changes affecting gameplay
4. Mini-games or puzzles related to village management
5. A creative mode with unlimited resources

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features or provide guidance on implementing a specific aspect of the game?
